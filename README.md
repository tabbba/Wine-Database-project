# Wine Dataset MySQL Exploration

This is a basic, simple project designed for practicing MySQL queries on a wine dataset. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding how to interact with a relational database using SQL through a series of pre-defined queries. The dataset encompasses various attributes of wines, including country, description, designation, points, and more, enabling users to perform complex SQL operations to extract meaningful insights.

To get started, run `databasebuilder.py` to set up your MySQL database and create the necessary tables. After building the database, execute `application.py` to interact with the dataset. This script will allow you to choose and run different SQL queries to explore the wine data further.
